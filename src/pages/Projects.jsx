              I developed a custom website for AllyCiv, an engineering firm specializing in water, to showcase their services and projects. After meeting with the team to gather their requirements, I created a mockup design that was approved before proceeding with the full website development. The website includes a stunning water animation and a user-friendly FAQ section with accordions, and is fully responsive across all devices. A custom contact form was created for visitors to easily reach out to the firm and all necessary qualifications and recent projects are displayed in an easy-to-read way. The website effectively represents the firm's services and capabilities and is sure to attract potential clients."

The website required membership for users to access digital tools for CO2 emissions calculations and assistance. The website would be linked with the book through QR codes and would have an easy-to-use interface for users to view their carbon footprint and track their progress. It would also include a news section, blog section, and security measures to protect user privacy. Furthermore, the website would have a user-friendly dashboard that displays the user's progress in reducing their carbon footprint, along with suggestions on how to further reduce it.
